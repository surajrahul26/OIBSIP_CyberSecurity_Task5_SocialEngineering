## 1. Introduction  
I was struck by how just **one phone call** led to a massive breach at Qantas‚Äîup to **6 million customers** had their personal data exposed through a vishing attack at a third-party call centre. This reminded me that our **human responses**, not just firewalls, are often the weakest link :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## 2. Types of Social Engineering Attacks  

### 2.1 Phishing  
- *Definition:* Bulk emails or SMS/messages that lure you into revealing credentials or clicking dodgy links.  
- *Example:* A fake ‚ÄúVPN‚Äù email tricked Twitter staff into giving up login details‚Äîled to high‚Äëprofile account takeovers in July 2020 :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

### 2.2 Spear‚ÄëPhishing & Whaling  
- Targeted attacks aimed at specific individuals, usually execs.  
- In Twitter's hack, attackers phoned select staff, impersonated IT, and stole multi‚Äëfactor auth codes :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

### 2.3 Vishing & Smishing  
- Voice (via phone) or SMS-based phishing.  
- Qantas breach was classic vishing‚Äîattackers spoofed a voice to access a vendor system :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

### 2.4 Pretexting  
- Creating a fake identity or scenario to manipulate someone.  
- Example: Posing as IT helpdesk staff is a common pretext.

### 2.5 Baiting  
- Physical traps like infected USB drives left in break rooms‚Äîstudies show almost everyone picks them up.

## 6. Conclusion  
What struck me most is that **software isn‚Äôt the sole defense**‚Äîeven the most secure systems can fall if **humans are deceived**. With attackers now using AI-driven tools, deepfake voices, and highly tailored scams, our best defense is **ongoing awareness, layered verification, and zero‚Äëblame training culture**.
