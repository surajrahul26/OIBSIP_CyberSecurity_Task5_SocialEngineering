## 1. Introduction

One of the most surprising things I discovered while researching cyber attacks is that the biggest weakness in security isn’t always software or firewalls — it’s people. For example, in July 2025, Qantas was targeted in a vishing (voice phishing) attack where a cybercriminal tricked a third-party call center. As a result, personal data of up to 6 million customers was compromised. This report explains how attacks like these happen and how we can defend against them.

## 2. Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### 2.1 Phishing
- **What it is:** Fake emails, websites, or messages that trick you into giving passwords or sensitive info.
- **Real case:** In 2020, Twitter employees were tricked into giving login credentials through a fake VPN login page. Hackers took over big accounts like Elon Musk and Apple to post Bitcoin scams.

### 2.2 Spear Phishing & Whaling
- **What it is:** Similar to phishing but more targeted. Attackers study the victim (e.g., a CEO) and send personal, convincing messages.
- **Impact:** These attacks often bypass spam filters and lead to big financial losses.

### 2.3 Vishing & Smishing
- **Vishing:** Phone calls pretending to be from support teams or banks.
- **Smishing:** SMS messages pretending to be urgent alerts.
- **Example:** The Qantas breach was caused by a fake call to their outsourced support staff.

### 2.4 Pretexting
- **What it is:** Attackers create a fake story (or pretext) to get information. For example, pretending to be HR or IT asking for login details.

### 2.5 Baiting
- **What it is:** Leaving infected USBs or files for victims to click. Once clicked, malware spreads.
- **Study:** In one experiment, 98% of people plugged in found USBs.

## 3. Real-Life Case Studies

### Qantas Vishing Attack (2025)
- **Summary:** A scammer called a third-party call center, impersonated an employee, and got access to Salesforce data.
- **Data Exposed:** Names, emails, birthdates, frequent-flyer details.
- **Impact:** Public trust was affected, and Qantas had to alert millions of customers.

### Twitter Hack (2020)
- **Summary:** Hackers created a fake VPN login page, tricked Twitter employees, and gained access to admin tools.
- **Accounts Affected:** Elon Musk, Apple, Barack Obama.
- **Result:** Tweets were posted asking for Bitcoin. Around $118,000 was stolen.

## 6. Conclusion

Social engineering is dangerous because it doesn’t need hacking tools — it only needs to trick one person. What surprised me most is how simple these tricks can be, but the damage they cause is huge. With training, awareness, and proper systems, we can avoid most of these attacks.
